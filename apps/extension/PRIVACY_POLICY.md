## Information We Collect

We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide the core functionality of the extension:

- **Authentication Information:** If you create an account or log in, we may collect your email address and authentication tokens to securely identify you.
- **Website Content:** When you save a page, we collect the URL, title, and optional metadata (such as images or descriptions) of the page you choose to save.
- **Web History:** We store a list of the web pages you explicitly save using the extension. We do **not** track your general browsing history.

We do **not** collect:
- Health, financial, or payment information
- Personal communications (emails, texts, chat messages)

We do **not** sell or transfer your data to third parties, except as required to provide the core service (e.g., cloud storage providers).

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share your personal data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Your data is only shared with trusted service providers (such as Supabase) as necessary to operate the extension.
